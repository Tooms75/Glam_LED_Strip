# Glam_LED_Strip

This is a simple Arduino project I created with my son.  THe objective is to create a project that can drive a configurable length of Adafruit DotStar LED strips using input commands from a spare RGB remote from a 'Glam' brand RGB globe light that we had lying around.  We wanted to use all the buttons on the remote and reproduce (and enhance) the features of that LED globe light.
